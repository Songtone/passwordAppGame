Trying to replicate the game password as seen on Jimmy Fallon

The point of the game is that a person of each team needs to get his team to guess the correct word.
The person giving the hint can only say one word with no gestures.
His team will then attempt to guess the correct word.
If they succeed, they get a point. If they don't, the next team will go a do the same process with the same word.
Once a team succeeds, another team member will give the clue for the next word.
This is how the game is played.
